# Shell Tools

Various shell tools I've created as needed.

## xc
- Tries to find all `.xcworkspace` and `.xcodeproj` files and presents them in a list

## .lldbinit
- A set of commands presented in the 2018 WWDC talk: Advanced Debugging with Xcode and LLDB

## nserror-decoder.swift
- A command-line tool written in Swift to decode raw byte arrays into (hopefully) helpful String(s).

## gitconfig
- Additional `git` commands that I'm used to using

## zshrc
- My typical `.zshrc` file with many aliases and `PATH` updates

## new-macbook.sh
- A setup script for whenever I get a new macOS device
