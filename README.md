# Shell Tools

Various shell tools I've created as needed.

## xc
- Tries to find all `.xcworkspace` and `.xcodeproj` files and presents them in a list

## .lldbinit
- A set of commands presented in the 2018 WWDC talk: Advanced Debugging with Xcode and LLDB

## nserror-decoder.swift
- A command-line tool written in Swift to decode raw byte arrays into (hopefully) helpful String(s).
